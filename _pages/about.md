I am a Master's student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC San Diego. My advisor, Professor
[Sicun Gao](https://scungao.github.io/), and I are currently investigating the intersection of machine learning and
optimization in decision and control problems.

# Software
- DeMAC [ [repo](https://github.com/ericyangyu/DeMAC) ]: lightweight framework for decentralized multi-agent coordination
- PPO for Beginners [ [repo](https://github.com/ericyangyu/PPO-for-Beginners) ]: pytorch tutorial for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Watersort solver [ [repo](https://github.com/ericyangyu/WatersortSolver) ]: solver for watersort mobile game
- Wordscape Solver [ [repo](https://github.com/ericyangyu/WordscapeSolverV2) ]: solver for wordscapes mobile game

# Passion Projects
I work closely with a local San Diego middle school to bring STEM to low-income and historically disadvantaged communities.
I am looking for collaborations to further enrich student experiences. Reach out to me if you have an idea
and we can talk. Here are some photos of past events:
