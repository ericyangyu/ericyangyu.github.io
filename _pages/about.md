I am a Master's student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC San Diego and proudly a first-generation college student. 
My advisor, Professor [Sicun Gao](https://scungao.github.io/), and I are currently investigating the intersection of machine learning and
optimization in decision and control problems. Specifically, how can we cheaply and reliably guarantee safety in high-dimensional, highly non-convex
optimization problems in deep reinforcement learning?

# Passion Projects
I work closely with a local San Diego middle school to bring STEM to low-income and historically disadvantaged communities.
Having grown up in a low-income household with no ties to industry or academia, I found myself overwhelmed coming into college.
Folks around me were coming in with high school internships, years of coding experience, parent mentors in big tech/positions of power, etc.,
all of which I didn't have access to. However, I am blessed to have found mentors in college that really changed my life. 
They showed me ropes that I didn't know existed, took risks on me that I didn't think I deserved, and taught me what kind of person I wanted to become.
These were the people that helped me grow and convinced me that yes, I belong here. Seeing how big an impact my mentors made on my life, 
I wish to do the same for others, especially those who can relate with my struggles. By giving back to the community, I aim to inspire and 
help others like how my mentors did for me. 

I am actively looking for collaborations to further enrich student experiences. Reach out to me if you have an idea
and we can talk. Past collaborations have included folks from Microsoft, Qualcomm, F5, UC San Diego, University of Washington, and more. 
Here are some photos of past events:
